  # Horizontal Pod Autoscaler uses this API to collect metrics
  # Any HPA target can be scaled based on the resource usage of the pods in the scaling target.
  # This is used to determine the resource utilization and used by the HPA controller to scale the target up or down.
  # HPA will increase and decrease the number of replicas (via the deployment) to maintain an average CPU or Memory utilization across all Pods
  metrics:

  # With this metric the HPA controller will keep the average utilization of the pods in the scaling target at 80%.
